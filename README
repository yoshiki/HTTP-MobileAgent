NAME
    HTTP::MobileAgent - HTTP mobile user agent string parser

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::MobileAgent;

      my $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new(Apache->request);
      # or $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new; to get from %ENV
      # or $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new($agent_string);

      if ($agent->is_docomo) {
          # or if ($agent->name eq 'DoCoMo')
          # or if ($agent->isa('HTTP::MobileAgent::DoCoMo'))
          # it's NTT DoCoMo i-mode.
          # see what's available in H::MA::DoCoMo
      } elsif ($agent->is_j_phone) {
          # it's J-Phone.
          # see what's available in H::MA::JPhone
      } elsif ($agent->is_ezweb) {
          # it's KDDI/EZWeb.
          # see what's available in H::MA::EZweb
      } else {
          # may be PC
          # $agent is H::MA::NonMobile
      }

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::MobileAgent parses HTTP_USER_AGENT strings of (mainly Japanese)
    mobile HTTP user agents. It'll be useful in page dispatching by user
    agents.

METHODS
    Here are common methods of HTTP::MobileAgent subclasses. More agent
    specific methods are described in each subclasses. Note that some of
    common methods are also overrided in some subclasses.

    new
          $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new;
          $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new($r);  # Apache or HTTP::Request
          $agent = HTTP::MobileAgent->new($ua_string);

        parses HTTP headers and constructs HTTP::MobileAgent subclass
        instance. If no argument is supplied, $ENV{HTTP_*} is used.

        Note that you nees to pass Aapche or HTTP::Requet object to new(),
        as some mobile agents put useful information on HTTP headers other
        than only "User-Agent:" (like "x-jphone-msname" in J-Phone).

    user_agent
          print "User-Agent: ", $agent->user_agent;

        returns User-Agent string.

    name
          print "name: ", $agent->name;

        returns User-Agent name like 'DoCoMo'.

    is_mobile
          if ($agent->is_mobile) {
              # it's really a mobile agent
          }

        returns if the agent is mobile or not.

    is_docomo, is_j_phone, is_ezweb
        returns if the agent is DoCoMo or J-Phone or EZWeb.

WARNINGS
    Following warnings might be raised when $^W is on.

    "%s: no match. Might be new variants. please contact the author of
    HTTP::MobileAgent!"
        User-Agent: string does not match patterns provided in subclasses.
        It may be faked user-agent or a new variant. Feel free to mail me to
        inform this.

NOTE
    "Why not adding this module as an extension of HTTP::BrowserDetect?"
        Yep, I tried to do. But the module's code seems hard enough for me
        to extend and don't want to bother the author for this
        mobile-specific features. So I made this module as a separated one.

MORE IMPLEMENTATIONS
    If you have any idea / request for this module to add new subclass, I'm
    open to the discussion or (more preferable) patches. Feel free to mail
    me.
